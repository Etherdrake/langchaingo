# Google AI Streaming Example

Hello, space enthusiasts and curious coders! 👋 This nifty little Go program demonstrates how to use Google's AI to answer questions about lunar exploration. How cool is that? 🚀

## What Does This Example Do?

This example showcases the power of the Google AI API by asking a simple yet fascinating question:

> "Who was the second person to walk on the moon?"

Using the `langchaingo` library, we connect to Google's AI service and retrieve an answer to this lunar query. It's like having a space historian right at your fingertips! 🔍

## How It Works

1. First, we set up our Google AI credentials using an API key.
2. We create a new Google AI client using the `googleai` package.
3. We pose our moon-walking question to the AI.
4. The AI ponders for a moment (much quicker than a moonshot!) and returns an answer.
5. We print out the response, revealing the identity of the second lunar stroller.

## Running the Example

To run this cosmic code:

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable with your Google AI API key.
3. Run the program with `go run googleai-streaming-example.go`.

And voilà! You'll have your answer faster than you can say "one small step for man"! 🌠

## Why It's Cool

This example demonstrates how easy it is to tap into powerful AI models for answering questions or generating content. It's a small step for code, but a giant leap for your projects!

Happy coding, and may your queries be as boundless as space itself! 🌍🌙✨
